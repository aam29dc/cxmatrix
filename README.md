# cxmatrix
c matrix library api is ROW MAJOR,
has automatic dynamic memory allocation,
contains a list of linear algebra functions to solve matrix equations,

cxmatrix was written by me (aam29dc@gmail.com) to learn linear algebra,
functions like matrix_inverse_slow are slow solutions for large matrices
