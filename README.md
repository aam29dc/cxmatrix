in _oldmain.c I've written a program to project vertices of a 3d cube onto the screen, and rotated its X and Y axis. A line is drawn between corresponding vertices using an adjacecy list (xadj.h). It uses (xdraw.h) functions to draw to screen: works on windows console, there maybe printing problems on linux terminals, due to screen sizes, try to increase the size of your terminal if it doesn't print correctly.

_saved_deprecated.c is a bunch of deleted/rewritten functions saved
