# cxmatrix
cxmatrix library is ROW MAJOR,
has automatic dynamic memory allocation,
contains a list of linear algebra functions to solve matrix equations,

cxmatrix was written by me (aam29dc@gmail.com) to learn linear algebra,

in _oldmain.c I've written a program to project vertices of a 3d cube onto the screen, and rotated its X and Y axis, using the cxmatrix lib I wrote.
(NOTE: likely doesn't work since I've rewrote lib, but same work flow), but for now i'm uploading the files just to save. One could easily figure it out.

functions like matrix_inverse_slow are slow solutions for large matrices, but I've kept them anyway, incase anyone wants to look at them.
