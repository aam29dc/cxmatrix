# cxmatrix
cxmatrix library is row major,
automatic dynamic memory allocator,
contains a list of linear algebra functions to solve matrix equations,

in _oldmain.c I've written a program to project vertices of a 3d cube onto the screen, and rotated its X and Y axis, using the cxmatrix lib and printf. It uses xdraw.h functions to draw to screen. Works on windows console, there maybe printing problems on linux terminals, due to screen sizes, try to increase the size of your terminal if it doesn't print correctly.

_saved_deprecated.c is a bunch of deleted/rewritten functions saved
